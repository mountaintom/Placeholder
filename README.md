A simple demo of TensorFlow Serving on iOS
## Please Note
This is a placeholder for the real project that is here:
https://github.com/mountaintom/TensorFlowServing-InceptionClient

The demo works great if you clone the project and do a "pod install" from the Example directory. 

However, because of impossible to fandom combinations of moving, mangling and directory tree flattening by Cocoapods, 
I have not been able to get it to compile as a Cocoapod, yet. The real project will be placed here when the code is cracked.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

TensorFlowServing-InceptionClient is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "TensorFlowServing-InceptionClient"
```

## SETTING UP A TEST SERVER 

You can set up a server by following the instructions on the TensorFlow Serving site:

https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/tfserve
https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/setup
https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/docker

I have a prebuilt Docker container available here:

docker pull mountaintom/tensorflow-serving-inception-docker-swarm-demo

This container has the Inception model already loaded and ready to go.

Start this container and run the following commands within it to get the server running:

```bash
$ cd /serving
$ bazel-bin/tensorflow_serving/model_servers/tensorflow_model_server --port=9000 --model_name=inception --model_base_path=inception-export &> inception_log &
```

A longer article on setting up a server is here:

## Note 

There are a few refinements I plan to add to this project, as they are properly tested.
The protobuf files may need to be recompiled if your version of Protocol Buffers does not match 
the one I used. I will put back the automatic proto file complilation as soon as it is tested.

In the meantime the protofiles may be compiled as follows:

From the Example directory:

```bash
cd ../TensorFlowServing-InceptionClient/Classes/third_party/ ;
find . -name "*.proto" -exec \
../../../Example/Pods/\!ProtoCompiler/protoc \
--objc_out=. \
-I . \
{} \;
find . -name "*_service.proto" -exec \
../../../Example/Pods/\!ProtoCompiler/protoc \
--plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=../../../Example/Pods/!ProtoCompiler-gRPCPlugin/grpc_objective_c_plugin \
--grpc_out=. \
-I . \
{} \;
cd -;
```
